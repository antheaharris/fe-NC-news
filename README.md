# NC News - Front End

NC News is a Reddit Style news aggregation application based around the discussion of articles. As a user you can view all articles on the home page and filter them by date, number of votes or comment count. They can view all articles on a certain topic by selecting a topic from the navigation bar and can then go on to vote on articles, comment and vote on others comments. The aim of the app is to be intuitive, reactive, responsive and provide an enjoyable user experience.
(Note: there is a preset logged-in user - jessjelly.)
